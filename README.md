#### Background
blah blah happiness 






#### Purpose
- Learn and understand the patterns that  
- Explore the main reason why people leave their home country
- Predict which countries produce the most amount of migrants and the trends they follow 

#### Goals
- Learn and understand where people will be immigrating from the most 
- Get a deeper understanding of data science technologies and methods (getting more comfortable with pandas, machine learning algorithms through scikit-learn , and working with ipynb files in VS Code)
- Understand the most appropriate approaches for a study, for instance, choosing an ML algorithm, choosing the best way to display certain kinds of data, etc


#### How Will This Be Done? 
- Take into account the pollution, poverty, crime rates, access to education, and corruption and compare these rates to the net migration rate for every country in the world
- Use machine learning algorithms to predict
